-   **“Unpacking the Gendered Dimensions of Political Violence: Coparticipation and Centrality of Women in the Rwandan Genocide” with Jared F. Edgerton, Elizabeth L. Brannon, & Hollie Nyseth Nzitatira**

    Abstract:

    How does gender impact genocidal violence? Previous research on genocide has explored the gendered dimensions of political violence, with scholars emphasizing that although women engage in and perpetrate genocidal violence, they are less likely to do so than men. In the Rwandan genocide, women’s participation was significantly more common than in other genocidal contexts, but scholars and practitioners have still ascertained that the majority of women participated differently than men due to the patriarchal norms, taking on primarily less violent looting roles while men primarily committed murders. Drawing on gendered understandings of genocide, armed conflict, and non-state armed groups, we focus on the individual decision of genocide participants to engage in violent acts and argue that an individual’s mobilization to participate in the violence is contingent on their own gender, as well as the gender of their mobilizer. In particular, we expect that women will play a key role in socializing other women toward violence. To test this argument, we leverage novel data on the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda. Using network analysis, we demonstrate women’s vital role in mobilizing other women to commit violence in Rwanda. This article builds on insights into the social network dynamics of various conflict settings and highlights the pertinence of disentangling gendered differences in network relationships.

-   **“Domestic Human Rights NGOs and Victim's Support in International Human Rights Litigation”**

    Abstract:

    How do victims of government human rights abuse gain access to international human rights litigation? Since the introduction of the individual communications mechanism to the U.N. treaty bodies in the year 1976, victims of government human rights abuses in some of the treaty signatory countries have increasingly utilized the mechanism to hold their governments accountable through international litigation, while citizens of other signatory countries are not making use of the mechanism, despite human rights violations frequently occurring within the countries. What causes this discrepancy? I argue that human rights organizations in authoritarian regimes play a crucial role in educating victims of government abuse about the mechanism and in supporting them in submitting individual communications after exhausting domestic remedies. I further argue that the number of human rights organizations within repressive regimes matters because victims need to be able to access human rights organizations, and a low number only allows access to very few victims, thereby reducing the likelihood of seeing individual communications submitted by victims from the respective country. A higher number of human rights organizations within a repressive regime will result in victims filing individual petitions. To test this argument, I utilize an original dataset of international non-government organization data and the number of individual communications to the UN treaty bodies. I find support for my theory that the number of human rights organizations within an autocratic regime matters for access to the individual communication mechanism.
