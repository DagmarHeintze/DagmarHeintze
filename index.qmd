I am a political science doctoral student, studying International Relations at [the University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/fact-sheets/epps/phd-political-science/). My research topics are Conflict, Human Rights, and International Law.

- My research focuses on conflict processes and political violence, specifically which factors mobilize individuals to participate in political violence and how this violence affects communities in the aftermath.

- I further focus on the prevention of torture and inhuman and degrading behavior or punishment and international mechanisms seeking to accomplish improved compliance with international human rights law.

- Furthermore, I research international human rights litigation at regional and international courts and the UN treaty bodies.
