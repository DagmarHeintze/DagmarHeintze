I am a doctoral student studying International Relations. My research topics are Conflict, Human Rights, and International Law.

My main research interests are :

-   My research focuses on conflict processes and political violence, specifically which factors mobilize individuals to participate in political violence and how this violence affects communities in the aftermath.

-   I further focus on the prevention of torture and inhuman and degrading behavior or punishment and international mechanisms seeking to accomplish improved compliance with international human rights law.

-   Furthermore, I research international human rights litigation at regional and international courts and the UN treaty bodies.
